Aliens exist and it is possible they are among us on Earth, the first Briton to go into space has said.

Dr Helen Sharman told the Observer Magazine that extra-terrestrial life is bound to be somewhere in the universe.

"Aliens exist, there's no two ways about it," she said, adding that "there must be all sorts of different forms of life" among the billions of stars.

Dr Sharman, 56, made history when she travelled to the Soviet space station Mir in May 1991.

The chemist, who now works at Imperial College, London, added that although aliens may not be made up of carbon and nitrogen like humans "it's possible they're here right now and we simply can't see them".
